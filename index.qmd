Hello world. My name is Yiran 依然. I'm a social psychologist and contemplative scientist (research meditation and compassion). I'm Chinese American, lived in China for 9 years and the US for more than 15 years. When I was finishing my PhD in 2024, I decided to live internationally, mostly in Asia. I like to take photographs of the moments that touched me and reflect on things I'm learning so I'm sharing them here.
